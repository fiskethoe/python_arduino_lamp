# python_arduino_lamp
A Python program scans a web page with beautiful soup and then checks for the number of times three keywords show up. Based on these numbers, the Arduino will choose the color of an RGB LED. It will also display the number of each keyword on an lcd. The Python program talks to the arduino using serial, as is the standard with Arduino.
